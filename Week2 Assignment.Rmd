Data frame for passing longitude and latitude values
 
```{r data frame}
library(leaflet)
 
Lng_Lat <- data.frame (
lat = c(42.4822,42.2139,42.9144,42.5781,42.3214,42.2394,42.4331),
lng = c(20.7458,20.7397,20.6897,21.5803,21.3583,21.0272,21.0397)
)
```
Lng_Lat
 
```{r hyperlinks}
Cities <- c("<a href= 'https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities'>Lat and Long data</a>")
```
 
 
## Including Plots
 
You can also embed plots, for example:
 
```{r test}
 
Lng_Lat %>%
leaflet () %>%
addTiles()  %>%
addMarkers(popup=Cities)

 
```
